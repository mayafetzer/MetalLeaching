# MetalLeaching
A repository to hold the ML model and streamlit app to predict the amount of metal extracted from LI batteries.

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application for predicting lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel leaching efficiency based on experimental input conditions.

The app uses machine-learning models trained with and without categorical variables, all of which were fully hyperparameter-tuned, cross-validated, and exported as .pkl files.

The web app allows users to upload new datasets and instantly generate predictions for all four metals using the tuned models.
